        <p>In a London where blasphemy laws have been reintroduced, a scientist discovers a secret in human DNA that could cost him his life.
        When he is forced onto a project and confronted with DMT – the most powerful hallucinogen known to science, things become a little strange.</p>

        <p>Please do consider signing up to Zygo’s mailing list either above this paragraph if you're on a mobile or to the left-hand side if you're on desktop. I can promise she will not bombard you with emails — nothing of the sort, actually, as she’s never been known for her work ethic. She will only email you with important news on the projects that are currently ongoing, although her choice of language is questionable at best so it's not a mailing list for the faint of heart.</p>

        <p>You will get to see more of Zygo in book 3, which starts where book 1 left off. Next, though, of course, is book 2, where we delve into the scientific dealings of Škýrotháma and follow the development of political Islam in the the United Kingdom. Mysteries surrounding those responsible for the Islamic influx into Europe and the two-tier justice meted out on its indigenous peoples unravel and leave exposed the answer to that most important of questions: why?</p>

      <p>If you would like to support this project as well as a virtual-reality game that is currently under development for book 1, please consider buying Zygo a coffee. The “Buy me a Coffee” button above will take you to her page. And if you have finished book 1 but don’t wish to join the mailing list or buy Zygo a coffee but still want to support the project, you can do so by leaving that book somewhere somebody can find it, like a café, a pub or a bus, or just approach somebody and give it to them as a gift! <br>If you would like to follow Zygo on Twitter you can do so @ZygoZugzwang or click on her photo below to be taken to her page, and you can email her at zygo@odlahgal.com.</p>

      <p>Thank you for your time; it really does mean a lot to me,</p>

      <p>May the Copulating Snakes be Your Guide!</p>
